# Myntra_Front_End_CLONEThis project is a clone of the popular Mynta app, built using [insert frontend technologies used, e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.]. My goal is to demonstrate my understanding of frontend concepts and techniques, while also brushing up my skills in:

- User interface design
- Responsive web development
- JavaScript functionality
